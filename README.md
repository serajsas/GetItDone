## _Phase 4: Task 2_ 

- I have used the Map interface, and it is implemented in the TodoList class in the model package. There are many methods
that are related to the use of the Map interface, mainly addition and removal of a task from a task list, changing a task
to being complete, incomplete or in-review, also deleting a task and returning specific task descriptions.
